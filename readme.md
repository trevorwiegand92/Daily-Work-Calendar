Finished homework assignment for week 5: Daily Work Scheduler.

Name: Daily Work Calender.

The objective of this week's assignment was, given the starter code to begin with, we had to manipulate the html , css, and javascript files to create a calender application that will allow the user to save appointments for each hour of the day.  Also using the moment function in javascript to track the current date and time for the website.

The user can input data into each time block and hit the save button on the right side of the page to save the data to local storage so when the user refreshes the page, the data will still be in that time block.
